contacting the mod team my brother inlaw sammy lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago he moved in with us and brought his twin daughters olivia sloane18 with him a couple of months ago his sister my wife and i have one daughter zoey 16 and she and her cousins are not close but get along fine olivia sloane have no respect for zoeys privacy none they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on makeup phone accessories clothes school laptop etc zoey complained a lot and i have already asked the girls to respect zoeys privacy and stop taking things my wife and sammy saw no issue with this after all they are girls and this is typical teenage girls behavior i completely disagreed last straw was when zoey bought a 60 mac makeupkit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it do not know much about makeup but that is what zoey said when she found the kit on her bed and was crying i told my wife and she said she would ask sloane to apologize but i got zoey a lock after i found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence sammy and his daughters saw the lock and were not happy the girls were extremely upset sammy asked about it and i straight up told him he said my daughters are not thieves it is normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and should not even be buying expensive adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in zoeys personality trying to appear older than she is he accused me of being overprotective and babying zoey with this level of enablement i told him this is between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on zoeys door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying i was supposed to treat them like daughters then demanded i remove it but i said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house she got mad i was implying we kick them out and said her familyll hate me for this so i reminded her that i let sammy and his family move in which is something her own family refused to do so she should start with shamingblaming them for not taking their own son and niecesgranddaughters in if it was not for her familys unwillingness to help we would not be dealing with this much disturbance at home everyone is been giving me and zoey silent

2726,HappyGardener52,i agree with you completely while teenage girls do borrow each others things they rarely return the items in the same condition they got them when our daughter was a teenager we were raising four children we tried to provide them with things that were important to them whatever age they were they earned extra money from extra chores or working for other people anything they bought with their money was theirs and it was up to them if they wanted to share it or noteven with their siblings our daughter was not allowed to borrow or lend items that we provided however we did not have to drive this home because our daughter knew we worked hard to provide her with things she wanted or needed she appreciated her belongings and took care of them my recommendation is to keep the lock on that door and and set a date for moveout helping family is fine for a predetermined time no one should expect relatives to provide a home and everything that goes with it for an undetermined length of time shame on this guy for taking advantage and being so unappreciativeand shame on his daughters for being so disrespectful about touching other peoples belongings our children were not even allowed to be in other peoples yards without asking permission first for retrieving a ball or something like that nowadays neighborhood children seem to think that all the yards belong to them we do not see things that way and we do not permit children in our yardfor safety reasons for insurance reasons and for just play respect of property reasons sooooyou are nta in fact it appears you are the only one there with any common sense stand firm,1,1625337596.0,"['agre', 'complet', 'teenag', 'girl', 'borrow', 'other', 'thing', 'rare', 'return', 'item', 'condit', 'got', 'daughter', 'teenag', 'rais', 'four', 'children', 'tri', 'provid', 'thing', 'import', 'whatev', 'age', 'earn', 'extra', 'money', 'extra', 'chore', 'work', 'peopl', 'anyth', 'bought', 'money', 'want', 'share', 'noteven', 'sibl', 'daughter', 'allow', 'borrow', 'lend', 'item', 'provid', 'howev', 'drive', 'home', 'daughter', 'knew', 'work', 'hard', 'provid', 'thing', 'want', 'need', 'appreci', 'belong', 'took', 'care', 'recommend', 'keep', 'lock', 'door', 'set', 'date', 'moveout', 'help', 'famili', 'fine', 'predetermin', 'time', 'one', 'expect', 'rel', 'provid', 'home', 'everyth', 'goe', 'undetermin', 'length', 'time', 'shame', 'guy', 'take', 'advantag', 'unappreciativeand', 'shame', 'daughter', 'disrespect', 'touch', 'peopl', 'belong', 'children', 'even', 'allow', 'peopl', 'yard', 'without', 'ask', 'permiss', 'first', 'retriev', 'ball', 'someth', 'like', 'nowaday', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'seem', 'think', 'yard', 'belong', 'see', 'thing', 'way', 'permit', 'children', 'yardfor', 'safeti', 'reason', 'insur', 'reason', 'play', 'respect', 'properti', 'reason', 'sooooyou', 'nta', 'fact', 'appear', 'one', 'common', 'sens', 'stand', 'firm']",52

2803,dieselt4r,nta at all op i got a younger sister that is 10 years younger around you are daughters age and people i have seen are missing a few points on this i am going to 1 makeup should not be shared in the first place that is how you transfer skin rashes flesh eating illnesses and cold sores so regardless of price it should not happenmy sister told me this as girls in her school were sharing makeup and a bunch got rashes as as one of them was using make up to cover her rash 2 regardless of what it is your daughter saved up her money and bought it does not matter what it is its her property and if she says no it means no as her cousins are adults they should under stand that and i very much doubt his 18 year old daughters use walmart makeup or ever have 3 your daughter is not feeling safe in her home and because of that is moving items out to protect them so putting the lock on the door can be seen as making her feel comfortable in her own space i do not see an issue with that she can always choose to not lock the door but if she feels more comfortable with it locked that is her choice that you gave her to feel safe and comfortable 4 the door lock does not prevent your daughter and her cousins from spending time together at all so your wife saying that is a little ridiculous but growing up my mom used to snoop in my room to make sure i did not have drugs or other things in my room your wife may do the same same thing and the lock will limit he snooping ability may be to embarrassed to say that is the reason and is just pushing the other reasoning because of that on the topic of girls her age share things some do some do not the people who i have seen actually share are very few outside of a very close bond between two sisters people who grew up together or went through some shit that brought them close 5 this is going to be presumptuous and out of left field and i am saying this as it is a possibility but may be far from the truth why is a grown man angry about a door lock it stops his daughters from taking things but is that what he is mad about or was he planning to go in her room him self now regardless of intent i would be wary of why my brother in law is as angry as he is that a door lock was put on a 16 year old girls room door this may be out of line but kind of gives me predator vibes again may be way off on that and is more mad about the principle of the door lock in the first place but still something to put stock in 6 make sure only you and your daughter have a key as at this point if you give one to your wife she will just give it to her neices if they ask and hide a key somewhere for use in emergencies,1,1625338173.0,"['nta', 'op', 'got', 'younger', 'sister', '10', 'year', 'younger', 'around', 'daughter', 'age', 'peopl', 'seen', 'miss', 'point', 'go', '1', 'makeup', 'share', 'first', 'place', 'transfer', 'skin', 'rash', 'flesh', 'eat', 'ill', 'cold', 'sore', 'regardless', 'price', 'happenmi', 'sister', 'told', 'girl', 'school', 'share', 'makeup', 'bunch', 'got', 'rash', 'one', 'use', 'make', 'cover', 'rash', '2', 'regardless', 'daughter', 'save', 'money', 'bought', 'matter', 'properti', 'say', 'mean', 'cousin', 'adult', 'stand', 'much', 'doubt', '18', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'use', 'walmart', 'makeup', 'ever', '3', 'daughter', 'feel', 'safe', 'home', 'move', 'item', 'protect', 'put', 'lock', 'door', 'seen', 'make', 'feel', 'comfort', 'space', 'see', 'issu', 'alway', 'choos', 'lock', 'door', 'feel', 'comfort', 'lock', 'choic', 'gave', 'feel', 'safe', 'comfort', '4', 'door', 'lock', 'prevent', 'daughter', 'cousin', 'spend', 'time', 'togeth', 'wife', 'say', 'littl', 'ridicul', 'grow', 'mom', 'use', 'snoop', 'room', 'make', 'sure', 'drug', 'thing', 'room', 'wife', 'may', 'thing', 'lock', 'limit', 'snoop', 'abil', 'may', 'embarrass', 'say', 'reason', 'push', 'reason', 'topic', 'girl', 'age', 'share', 'thing', 'peopl', 'seen', 'actual', 'share', 'outsid', 'close', 'bond', 'two', 'sister', 'peopl', 'grew', 'togeth', 'went', 'shit', 'brought', 'close', '5', 'go', 'presumptu', 'left', 'field', 'say', 'possibl', 'may', 'far', 'truth', 'grown', 'man', 'angri', 'door', 'lock', 'stop', 'daughter', 'take', 'thing', 'mad', 'plan', 'go', 'room', 'self', 'regardless', 'intent', 'would', 'wari', 'brother', 'law', 'angri', 'door', 'lock', 'put', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'room', 'door', 'may', 'line', 'kind', 'give', 'predat', 'vibe', 'may', 'way', 'mad', 'principl', 'door', 'lock', 'first', 'place', 'still', 'someth', 'put', 'stock', '6', 'make', 'sure', 'daughter', 'key', 'point', 'give', 'one', 'wife', 'give', 'neic', 'ask', 'hide', 'key', 'somewher', 'use', 'emerg']",4

zoey complained a lot and i have already asked the girls to respect zoeys privacy and stop taking things at first this sounds overprotective a 3rd persons view whom is the poster may be bias but then i kept reading ruined it by mixing shades together this could be overdramatic maybe some perfectionism or something but then i kept reading i found she was moving valuable belongings out the house this is where i 180d teenagers do not hide shit out of their home unless they are legitimately scared it is going to be taken away this is where everything you said got clarity she is not just whining or complaining she is showing that she does not trust her own room as a place of safety for her belongings any more that is a problem and you have addressed it well with a lock girls were extremely upset either it is a lock for privacy or a lock because of you if the mere presence of the lock is upsetting you admit she did not want to loan you stuff and you were just taking it from her if she did want to loan you stuff just ask like before my daughters are not thieves clearly that is why you are all upset over a lock it is a lock it can be unlocked it is up to zoey it is not an accusation it is just a lock my wife take care of this defect in zoeys personality trying to appear older than she is i would lose it on someone if they said that i am a straight guy but holy shit the things a skilled person can do with makeup is fascinating all that blending and color matching can go right into design art skills or hollywood halloween make up artist stuff never ever snuff a passion by calling it a defect what the actual fuck for her cousins to see preventing them from spending time with her supposed to treat them like demanded i remove it i was implying we kick them out her familyll hate me for this your wife is clearly acting out of worry of her families judgement she is letting them get away with shit they should not because she is afraid they will judge her over it maybe she does care about zoeys privacy but her families perception is overriding that you drawing a line at the brother in law moving out has only reinforced that perception you have no moral obligation to do what i am about to suggest you are 100 in the right as it is but if you want to deescalate you should probably find a way to apologize for any perception you may because or any accusations you have made call yourself out as getting upset or something but at the end make sure you keep the lock the family is not mad about the lock only the daughters are the family is mad at

2323,grandma_visitation,nta for the lock i will be honest the fact that you did not do something about the situation until after you found out zoey was moving her valuables is not great you should have had her back before it got that bad her saying i was supposed to treat them like daughters if you had another daughter who was doing this to zoey a lock would be absolutely appropriate your wife will be lucky if zoey talks to her after she grows up and moves out you should talk with zoey about everything that is missing or ruined make a list with the cost present a copy of that to sammy and his girls as a bill i strongly suggest you quietly reimburse zoey whether sammy pays up or not but it is important to make the intruders face the cost of their actions there are now 4 people in your house emotionally abusing your daughter it is up to you to protect her that means getting sammy and his daughters out of there to start you said he lost his house but he did not lose his job right he needs to go rent a place try talking to your wife first because that is what spouses should do but it sounds like she may not cooperate so you may have to play hardball but it is up to you to protect your baby so do what you have to do unleash your inner father bear make an appointment with a couples counselor ask wife to join you if she refuses go anyway you could use an ally who will listen to you and give you ideas for getting through to your wife if your wife does not want to go to counseling with you tell her it is that or divorce because she is failing in her 1 job protecting your child and is in fact now actively participating in abusing your child so pick a card marriage counselor or divorce attorney any chance sammy has been there less than 30 days so far if so kick him out immediately physically carry his stuff outside if needed if you stay under that 30 day limit you have a decent argument that they were just guests not tenants if he is been there longer give sammy and each of the girls written notice to be out within 30 days hand them the papers but also text them so you have easy proof of delivery you are safest serving the girls as well for see ya since they are over 18 the written notice starts the clock so you can have them legally evicted in a month if necessary hopefully it will make them realize you are serious and they will move on voluntarily who owns your house if your wife is on the deed as well the truth is that you may not be able to file eviction on them without her agreement but you do not have to mention that to anyone right now but if it looks like you may have to pursue this legally you will want to research that a little more before filing paperwork the alternative is to rent an airbnb for you and zoe help her pack her stuff and you and she move out tell your wife you will be back when sammy is gone leave zoes room locked even though most of her stuff is out i do not normally advocate using financial leverage in a marriage but if you are the sole earner shift your assets around move half the existing savings to a separate account and redirect your paycheck to the new account hopefully you moving zoe to a safe place will make your wife wake up and kick her brother out but if not it is good to protect yourself good luck with everything,1,1625334458.0,"['nta', 'lock', 'honest', 'fact', 'someth', 'situat', 'found', 'zoey',

2469,Snoo_68114,nta sammy needs to learn to teach his daughters boundaries i am a makeup lover myself and mac is a very high end brand your 16 year old might not need it but the fact of the matter is that she spent her own money on it and therefore sammy does not get to say what she should or should not be able to buy with her own money regardless of her age if zoey is not old enough to be buying such expensive makeup then the same can be said of sloane and olivia they are only 18 that is not a significant age difference between girls that age but more importantly as a makeup enthusiast there is a hard set rule about it you do not share makeup that is a great way to contract staph bacterial conjunctivitis styes herpes if someone who you shared say your lipstick had it or even because worse acne due to sharing bodily oils and dead skin from makeup or makeup brushes that have not been properly cleaned that alone is reason enough for zoeys makeup to not be touched and enough of a reason to lock it up so her rude cousins cannot because those problems if you need to get a locking cosmetics hard case for zoey so if your wife attempts to take the lock off her door her makeup is protected measure her largest and most expensive items that she would not want used and then buy a box or multiple even to stash it away if olivia and sloane want their own makeup they need to purchase it your wife should know better than to allow girls to share makeup i have seen girls get awful infections from mishandling and sharing makeup and suffer permanent vision loss i am not even kidding i would tell him this sammy your daughters continue to barge into zoeys room and taking things and not giving her space taking things without permission is still stealing it does not matter if the item was returned which in this case was a mac makeup kit because makeup actually should not be shared your girls or mine could very well develop a serious infection by sharing makeup get staph infections stye eye pink eye herpescold sores or really bad acne so no sharing is not normal especially in regards to cosmetics sloane and olivia need to get their own things if they want makeup you also do not get to tell zoey what is age appropriate makeup when she bought those cosmetics with her own money period that does not mean she is defective she is old enough to purchase the makeup she wants so that is up to her the lock will continue to stay on zoeys door until your daughters can learn to respect boundaries space and other peoples property which is the true personality flaw that needs to be corrected zoey made her boundaries clear and olivia and sloane continued to cross them since they were warned and still continued to impose on zoey i felt it was in her best interest to put the lock on the door if sloane and olivia want to borrow something or hang out with her they will have to do the respectful thing and ask zoey instead of barging in need i remind you you are guests here stop being rude and allowing your daughters to act entitled to the things in this home also if your wife feels that that is unfair then she can go out of her way to purchase them their own things be sure

3396,ruat_caelum,nta you need to have a serious conversation with your wife in private where no one including your child can overhear about when her brother and family are going to leave you need to do this without pressure but as a way to plan your lives moving forward if the plan is 3 months you can just stomach the bs if it is 5 years you will likely have to react differently etc first things first you and your wife need to be on the same page if you think 6 months is too long and she thinks 5 years is okay you need to tackle that as a couple if she does not know what her brothers expectations are she needs to find out this is not pushing them out but you need a date to work with and plan around if he does not know then you likely just your wife and her brother need to make a plan to work toward coming up with an answer everyone in the house needs to understand who the guests are and who the hosts are if you feel the rules of your house have been violated then a lock is acceptable you absolutely do not want this to be confrontational with your wife that being said people who are not normally in a position to make tough calls not sure what your wife does for work life experience will feel like you are asking them to choose your family over her brothers family if you know it is going to end in a fight do not bring it up seek help priest shrink etc someone you both respect who can help guide the conversation even if the plan is 5 years from now that is fine if it is fine with both you and your wife but some sort of structure needs to be put in place so that the 3 adults can have meaningful conversations kids it is hard but try not to police his children if they break the rules bring it up with him and ask him to address it with his kids if he cannot they need to go or you need to put up with it likewise do not let him police your child have a conversation with him if he does so and with your child 16 who can let you know if that is happening good fences good fences make good neighbors lots of strategies on how to deal with family during covid lockdowns will be applicable to your living situation get reading make schedules who gets tv picking powers when etc and make sure everyone has a place room space where they can go to get away from everyone else just to get away if they want even if it is sitting in the car in the driveway reading a book respect that alone time threeway congrats you are now in a threeway but it involves your wifes brother most 3way relationships do not fail on the sex part not applicable to your situation but because one member feels torn between the two other members who ask them to constantly pick sides your wife likely feels she has to pick emotional sides between her brother and you likely with more than this lock issue this is a real relationship you will have to invest time in and not just your wife the brother is going to need to be included in discussions decisions etc good luck these things can really test a marriage and people patience so long as everyone including the brother is of the same general mind on everyone helping out not mooching eventually moving on etc it is going to work out where it gets real ugly is when people have different motives goals and expectations,1,1625345262.0,"['nta', 'need', 'seriou', 'convers', 'wife', 'privat', 'one', 'includ', 'child', 'overhear',

her dysfunctional brother and to some extent herself she can only live with one side being unhappy and you are going to have to assert that that side is not you and zoey it is a huge struggle because while she does not want to lose you or zoey she does not want her brother to feel unhappy in any way even if it is at you zoey's expense she probably figures that you should understand as she once had to you have to stand your ground in order to show her that that is unacceptable you are her husband not an enabler and you are the last alarm for this ship before it sinks into dysfunction maybe as a child your wife was expected to ""understand"" ""get over it"" or sacrifice things that were dear to her because her family shamed her and said she was ""selfish"" for even remotely thinking about her herself bil is probably fully aware of this and uses it to his advantage by ""shaming"" your daughter into relenting as hehis family once did your wife and he is challenging you too but there is only 'one cock on this hill' and it are not him and you noted that her own family did not want to deal with bil they expect her to sacrifice her things you and zoey included because they cannot afford him using up their resources and in some way your wife probably doing that with zoey it is okay to sacrifice and destroy her things because your wife cannot afford to be that one again i agree with

is when all hell will break loose bil is going to call you every name in the book the girls are going to show out and bil's going to amp that shit up to 1000000 on your wife he is going to go for the emotional jugular ""how could you do this"" ""you are letting him decide i am your brother"" ""your daughter is a spoiled brat you are putting your kid's feelings over mine"" ""you really want us to be homeless"" the answer to all those questions are yes yes yes yes because there is a reason why bil's ass is divorced and it is not you or your wife's duty to save him your wife has to understand that if you do not do this now it will never end because it will never be enough for bil and zoey's going to resent the hell out of her as your wife probably does with her own family for sticking her

bed nor did they do anything else by accident before either did they offer to replace the damage or did they deflect the blame back onto her they are making sure she knows her place below them this

there should be to it they are going to keep bullying your daughter and she should not have to feel that kind of anxiety in her own home she is taking valuables over to friends houses because she does not feel like anything will be safe in her home just valuables though not the things her cousins would be likely to actually use but rather the things which she knows they will target next if she thought it was just them innocently borrowing things and being annoyed by it would not she hide the things they would use instead she is hiding things which elevate her status because she consciously or not knows what they are after you have done well so far been supportive backed up your daughter like a parent should while your wife has been a brick wall but you need to get control of your house why is your brother in law telling you how to handle your kids he is under your roof taking your charity if he is showing anything other than deference and gratitude you remind him where he is same goes for the kids you are trying to use reason and get them to understand you are doing that because your side is reasonable and you think they should understand reason and change their ways it is admirable it is fair and it is also a complete waste of your time your house your rules end of story do not let them argue with you or deflect if you want them to jump they can ask how high you tried to be reasonable it clearly did not and will not work not in the long run and in the meantime your kid is still going to be dealing with a hostile environment imagine your mom giving you the silent treatment because you did not want to be a victim in your own home your wife needs to see that she is putting peace in the house and family over the interests of her own kid she knows damn well how she would feel if her brothers probably ex wife lived with you and treated her the way her nieces treat your daughter absolutely shameful on her part hopefully she wakes the fuck

1236,babsibu,what the actual fuck first of nta now this is soooo wrong in soooo many levels and there are a few boundaries you need to set sorry but this comment will be huge 1 you need to talk to your wife she's being a bad mom and many levels she needs to change drastically otherwise the damage done to your daughter their relation and your marriage will be huge 1a her priority should be her daughter she should be defending your daughter and taking her problems seriously by degrading her feelings she's causing very much harm she's harming her motherdaughterrelationship and she's harming zoey's psychological health i wouldn't wonder if zoey goes lowcontact to her once she's able to move out because her mother isn't taking her biggest job seriously protecting her 1b if her own family didn't want their own flesh and blood in their houses why does she think they expect you to put up with his shit that's not how this works 1c you have no obligation to be accomodating them even less to treat them like your daughters but you can play along and say you need to teach kids how to be decent human beings people need to understand and respect boundaries those girls don't respect any of zoey's so you're making sure they learn it the hard way 1d by teaching zoey she needs to give in to everyone overstepping her boundaries she'll learn she's worth nothing she'll learn it's okay to be treated poorly she'll accept anything anyone does to her what does your wife want that zoey ends in an abusive relationship because she never learned to set boundaries never learned her worth but learned that her own mother will never back her up when she needs her because that's exactly what she's teaching zoey 2 bil interfering with your education you give your daughter is a big nono you need to kill those atempts radically he is a guest and not a parent he can educate his own brats but not your daughter 2a actually i have 2 anectodes for that and that's the only right way to react when i was about zoey's age i really wanted a allstars the shoes i was even wanting to pay for them myself because i just thought they were sooo cool when we were at my grandma's house my uncle my mom's brother came by and heard i wanted those shoes and my dad was thinking of buying me a pair he started going on about teaching kids they can't have everything any my father should buy me fake ones i wouldn't need original ones my father calmly looked at my uncle and said he doesn't interfere on how he raises his children living their expensive lifestyle and stuff and how on earth did my uncle expect that his opinion was asked in the way my father raised his daughter that's none of his business and he has no right to even think he can say anything to that matter my uncle a person who never loses his voice were absolutely speecheless and left shortly after another time i was already an adult but living under my parents' roof my aunt also my mom's sister came over and was talking to my parents how they shouldn't let me go on holidays by myself and they were being bad parents by not taking care of me properly my dad pretty much exploded and showed her where the door was 3 if guests can't act like guests they don't deserve being treated like ones if they don't respect boundaries they need to pack their stuff and leave bil is already overstaying and needs to get his shit together and move out otherwise his parents need to step in and take them in if her family starts taking shit about and to you show them their hipocrisy why is it your job to take them in but not theirs bil is not your kid he's theirs as my mom would say chilli just hurts when it's in your asshole 4 you need to protect zoey because apparatly she has no one else she needs to be able to count on you don't back down stand your ground go through hell if it's necessary but your daughter needs to know she's loved and valued edit 5 go buy your daughter a new make up set if you can afford it and give the old one to charity not to those brats and let them use your wife's make up instead if your wifes insists that sharing is caring also tell your wife she needs to share her own stuff with the twins she needs to set a good example as a mother right she'll see very soon that giving up your own privacy and belongings isn't that funny again chilli just hurts when it's in your own

my daughters are not thieves it is normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff but they are thieves they went into your daughters room without asking saw something they wanted and just took it borrow implies permission to borrow something you have to ask the rightful owners permission and the owner has to say yes simply being all teenagers and family does not entitle them to use their cousins stuff like it is their own and taking things without permission is stealing whether he likes it or not he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and should not even be buying expensive adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in zoeys personality trying to appear older than she is okay first of all that is really none of his business she is not his daughter it is her money that she worked hard for and saved up second of all how exactly can this guy seriously rationalize that working hard and saving money to buy expensive adult makeup is somehow a defect in your daughter but not his precious angels who stole it from their cousin and helped themselves to it after all it does not stop being expensive adult makeup just because his daughters used it instead of yours just because they stole it instead of buying it themselves does not mean they did not use expensive adult makeup so if he truly sees wanting to use expensive adult makeup as a flaw in your daughter he must see it as a flaw in his i would love to hear the logic of how it is not he accused me of being overprotective and babying zoey with this level of enablement he is the enabler here he is clearly showing favoritism towards his own children and even encouraging this behavior instead of stopping it and your wife taking his side instead of your daughters is not helping and will likely because a rift between them she got mad i was implying we kick them out and said her familyll hate me for this so i reminded her that i let sammy and his family move in which is something her own family refused to do so she should start with shamingblaming them for not taking their own son and niecesgranddaughters in if it was not for her familys unwillingness to help we would not be dealing with this much disturbance at home at the end of the day whether they like it or not these people are guests in your home you are

631,redcore4,esh except your daughter your conflict resolution and communication skills are atrocious for a person who has an almostgrown daughter it would have been reasonable to talk to your wife about how inadequate her attempt to resolve this was to insist that full repayment for the makeup was made to speak to your bil and explain that your daughter was hiding his stuff because his kids really are thieves and to empower your daughter to fight her own corner on this yes sharing stuff is normal between sisters but so are vicious and sometimes violent fights until everyone matures enough to respect each other's boundaries and if your daughter has no siblings she is not used to sharing her space or representing herself these are valuable life skills you would be surprised how many only children really struggle with territorial disputes in house shares or workplaces when they first leave home and mummy and daddy cannot just make it all better for them buying and fitting a lock without consulting your wife is just a dick move it undermines her when she is said she will deal with it and it shows you do not think her opinion or input are valuable which is made worse by there being other adults in the house to witness it and then you said it was a matter for communication between your wife and yourself when this failure to communicate was noticed you cannot have it both ways and this is not gradea husbanding or wifing you did not specify the reasons the other adults here suck are more obvious your bro in law's kids probably do not see this as a big deal because they have shared their whole lives and have never had to negotiate boundaries in the same way and it sounds like their ability to show respect is compromised by their role models all being quite dismissive of them and of each other when boundaries are violated but they are old enough to know that if they take something and someone is upset by their actions they are financially and personally responsible for making it right they should not need to be instructed to apologise or to replace a damaged item at their age your bro in law probably feels outnumbered by having twins and has not bothered to discipline them and he is failing to respect anybody at all here in his desire to indulge his daughters' behaviour he is also criticising you and your wife for your parenting whilst living in your home rude he should be offering to replace the damaged item if he is daughters refuse and it would have been reasonable for you to set that expectation you did not it sounds like you just lost your temper at him instead of setting this out verbally it is clear that in your opinion he has long outstayed his welcome but you do not seem to have discussed this with him or your wife or set proper boundaries for his stay and your wife does not suck for her feelings towards you but should have listened to and stuck up for her daughter a lot better than she did before it came to this point where your expectations and parenting choices differ from hers it is her responsibility as well as yours to communicate properly and manage conflicts with a little more maturity than any of you
