sloane and olivia they are only 18 that is not a significant age difference between girls that age but more importantly as a makeup enthusiast there is a hard set rule about it you do not share makeup that is a great way to contract staph bacterial conjunctivitis styes herpes if someone who you shared say your lipstick had it or even because worse acne due to sharing bodily oils and dead skin from makeup or makeup brushes that have not been properly cleaned that alone is reason enough for zoeys makeup to not be touched and enough of a reason to lock it up so her rude cousins cannot because those problems if you need to get a locking cosmetics hard case for zoey so if your wife attempts to take the lock off her door her makeup is protected measure her largest and most expensive items that she would not want used and then buy a box or multiple even to stash it away if olivia and sloane want their own makeup they need to purchase it your wife should know better than to allow girls to share makeup i have seen girls get awful infections from mishandling and sharing makeup and suffer permanent vision loss i am not even kidding i would tell him this sammy your daughters continue to barge into zoeys room and taking things and not giving her space taking things without permission is still stealing it does not matter if the item was returned which in this case was a mac makeup kit because makeup actually should not be shared your girls or mine could very well develop a serious infection by sharing makeup get staph infections stye eye pink eye herpescold sores or really bad acne so no sharing is not normal especially in regards to cosmetics sloane and olivia need to get their own things if they want makeup you also do not get to tell zoey what is age appropriate makeup when she bought those cosmetics with her own money period that does not mean she is defective she is old enough to purchase the makeup she wants so that is up to her the lock will continue to stay on zoeys

sloane continued to cross them since they were warned and still continued to impose on zoey i felt it was in her best interest to put the lock on the door if sloane and olivia want to borrow something or hang out with her they will have to do the respectful thing and ask zoey instead of barging in need i remind you you are guests here stop being rude and allowing your daughters to act entitled to

have to ask the rightful owners permission and the owner has to say yes simply being all teenagers and family does not entitle them to use their cousins stuff like it is their own and taking things without permission is stealing whether he likes it or not he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and should not even be buying expensive adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in zoeys personality trying to appear older than she is okay first of all that is really none of his business she is not his daughter it is her money that she worked hard for and saved up second of all how exactly can this guy seriously rationalize that working hard and saving money to buy expensive adult makeup is somehow a defect in your daughter but not his precious angels who stole it from their cousin and helped themselves to it after all it does not stop being expensive adult makeup just because his daughters used it instead of yours just because they stole it instead of buying it themselves does not mean they did not use expensive adult makeup so if he truly sees wanting to use expensive adult makeup as a flaw in your daughter he must see it as a flaw in his i would love to hear the logic of how it is not he accused me of being overprotective and babying zoey with this level of enablement he is the enabler here he is clearly showing favoritism towards his own children and even encouraging this behavior instead of stopping it and your wife taking his side instead of your daughters is not helping and will likely because a rift between them she got mad i was implying we kick them out and said her familyll hate me for this so i reminded her that i let sammy and his family move in which is something her own family refused to do so she should start with shamingblaming them for not taking their own son and niecesgranddaughters in if it was not for her familys unwillingness to help we would not be dealing with this much disturbance at home at the end of the day whether they like it or not these people are guests in your home you are doing something incredibly nice for them that you did not have to do

rashes as as one of them was using make up to cover her rash 2 regardless of what it is your daughter saved up her money and bought it does not matter what it is its her property and if she says no it means no as her cousins are adults they should under stand that and i very much doubt his 18 year old daughters use walmart makeup or ever have 3 your daughter is not feeling safe in her home and

not lock the door but if she feels more comfortable with it locked that is her choice that you gave her to feel safe and comfortable 4 the door lock does not prevent your daughter and her cousins from

do the same same thing and the lock will limit he snooping ability may be to embarrassed to say that is the reason and is just pushing the other reasoning because of that on the topic of girls her age

brought them close 5 this is going to be presumptuous and out of left field and i am saying this as it is a possibility but may be far from the truth why is a grown man angry about a door lock it

good chance to teach them about sharing and socializing there is however a line beyond which forcing a child to share goes to far once a child reaches a certain age it becomes important to not just teach them about respect but also to respect their privacy and possessions in op's case sammey's twin daughters have exceeded the extent to which sharing and hospitality should extend at 16 years of age zoey is nearing adulthood and deserves to have her possessions and privacy respected sure if the cousins needed something encouraging sharing is ok but if she refuses that is her right especially when it comes to property she purchased herself at her age her room should be considered something of a separate entity from the rest of the house a space she can call her own and have her claim be respected i salute op for enabling his daughters right to privacy and personal possessions were i to be in your position i would not remove the lock even after sammy's and his gang leave the home keep

going on here your bils twin daughters are sisters and their purchases are usually shared between each other because their parents purchased them they have likely grown up in a household where they have to share everything having your bil and wife try to make the best of this situation and pretend they have sort of combined families can erase the usual boundaries for the nieces \"our house is your house\" is never meant to be literal and most people know this implicitly not everyone does though depending on how things were done in their own home children going through divorce and homelessness are not in the best place to observe boundaries either your daughter did not grow up like this she is not accustomed to people rifling through her belongings without permission even if she were expected to share the things you and your wife provide this makeup set was purchased by her with her own money and therefore should not be shared unless she chooses to share it your nieces are old enough to respect your previous requests for daughter's privacy and to deal with whatever hurt feelings they have about not being allowed to touchuse things that do not belong to them i understand that they are dealing with a lot of stress from their parents separating and becoming homeless but your real problem is their father and aunt are encouraging this behavior you might want to really talk to your daughter about being more sensitive to their situation in detail about how difficult and scary this level of uncertainty can be and how much she might appreciate kindness in that situation empathy and compassion for situations worse than your own is a life skill that said the lock should stay and you should continue to support your daughter your wife's family are guests in your home being family does not mean they do not have to observe boundaries nor does it mean they are entitled to use other people's belongings without permission i second the person who suggested the

for taking care of your daughters sense of safety and autonomy it might be worth it to ait down together with your wife and really talk this out possibly with a therapist to have an unbiased third party that is up to you though i say that because if your wife thinks this behavior is okayit is not then she probably has some of this mentality internalised which likely causes her suffering working through it could possibly be a huge liberation point for her be prepared to find out how it has come up in your relationship and make changes out of love that honor any new boundaries she has so she can feel how important that isfor her and your daughter please post updates once again proud of you edit maybe let your wife know this is very important to keeping a relationship with your daughter if her strategy is to remove the valuable things from the house because of fear of them being damaged then that is her innate strategy she will do that with herself when she is older she will remove herslf from the lives of people who disrespect herwhich is very good the opposite would be thinking she has no value and letting herself be abused like the makeup your daughter is learning that if a place is unsafe to remove what you do not want damaged from it a lot of parents do not see their kids much after they move out because their children do not feel safe around them and the parents do not figure out how to make them feel safe that is why queer people for example usually move away from small towns to big cities and never go back etc their autonomy and identity is not respected back home so they make their identity safe by taking it somewhere it is and not going back this may be the tip of a very deep iceberg you have the chance to address your 16 year old daughter deserves to be her own person and have that autonomy respected she is lucky to have you and i am sure that means the world to her and she will remember she had you in her corner thank you so so much for being a

they can even continue arguing it is ok does not make sense 2 how does the value of the kit matter they took an item from your daughter and damaged it especially as a guest in your house they should be extra careful and willing to reimburse an damage 3 in a healthy relationship you can always do a quick ask before you take peoples stuff in fact if they were trying to be friendly with your daughter maybe they could try to arrange to do makeup together i do not know of course the relationship is already way too soured for this but as house guests you are supposed to show effort to try to

is not great you should have had her back before it got that bad her saying i was supposed to treat them like daughters if you had another daughter who was doing this to zoey a lock would be absolutely appropriate your wife will be lucky if zoey talks to her after she grows up and moves out you should talk with zoey about everything that is missing or ruined make a list with the cost present a copy of that to sammy and his girls as a bill i strongly suggest you quietly reimburse zoey whether sammy pays up or not but it is important to make the intruders face the cost of their actions there are now 4 people in your house emotionally abusing your daughter it is up to you to protect her that means getting sammy and his daughters out of there to start you said he lost his house but he did not lose his job right he needs to go rent a place try talking to your wife first because that is what spouses should do but it sounds like she may not cooperate so you may have to play hardball but it is up to you to protect your baby so do what you have to do unleash your inner father bear make an appointment with a couples counselor ask wife to join you if she refuses go anyway you could use an ally who will listen to you and give you ideas for getting through to your wife if your wife does not want to go to counseling with you tell her it is that or divorce because she is failing in her 1 job protecting your child and is in fact now actively participating in abusing your child so pick a card marriage counselor or divorce attorney any chance sammy has been there less than 30 days so far if so kick him out immediately physically carry his stuff outside if needed if you stay under that 30 day limit you have a decent argument that they were just guests not tenants if he is been there longer give sammy and each of the girls written notice to be out within 30 days hand them the papers but also text them so you have easy proof of delivery you are safest serving the girls as well for see ya since they are over 18 the written notice starts the clock so you can have them legally evicted in a month if necessary hopefully it will make them realize you are serious and they will move on voluntarily who owns your house if your wife is on the deed as well the truth is that you may not be able to file eviction on them without her agreement but you do not have to mention that to anyone right now but if it looks like you may have to pursue this legally you will want to research that a little more before filing paperwork the alternative is to rent an airbnb for you and zoe help her pack her stuff and you and she move out tell your wife you will be back when sammy is gone leave zoes room locked even though most of her stuff is out i do not normally advocate using financial leverage in a marriage but if you are the sole earner shift your assets around move half the existing savings to a separate account and redirect your paycheck to the new account hopefully you moving zoe to a safe place will make your wife wake up and kick her brother out but if not it is good to protect yourself good luck with everything", "Votes": 1, "Time":

this without pressure but as a way to plan your lives moving forward if the plan is 3 months you can just stomach the bs if it is 5 years you will likely have to react differently etc first things first you and your wife need to be on the same page if you think 6 months is too long and she thinks 5 years is okay you need to tackle that as a couple if she does not know what her brothers expectations are she needs to find out this is not pushing them out but you need a date to work with and plan around if he does not know then you likely just your wife and her brother need to make a plan to work toward coming up with an answer everyone in the house needs to understand who the guests are and who the hosts are if you feel the rules of your house have been violated then a lock is acceptable you absolutely do not want this to be confrontational with your wife that being said people who are not normally in a position to make tough calls not sure what your wife does for work life experience will feel like you are asking them to choose your family over her brothers family if you know it is going to end in a fight do not bring it up seek help priest shrink etc someone you both respect who can help guide the conversation even if the plan is 5 years from now that is fine if it is fine with both you and your wife but some sort of structure needs to be put in place so that the 3 adults can have meaningful conversations kids it is hard but try not to police his children if they break the rules bring it up with him and ask him to address it with his kids if he cannot they need to go or you need to put up with it likewise do not let him police your child have a conversation with him if he does so and with your child 16 who can let you know if that is happening good fences good fences make good neighbors lots of strategies on how to deal with family during covid lockdowns will be applicable to your living situation get reading make schedules who gets tv picking powers when etc and make sure everyone has a place room space where they can go to get away from everyone else just to get away if they want even if it is sitting in the car in the driveway reading a book respect that alone time threeway congrats you are now in a threeway but it involves your wifes brother most 3way relationships do not fail on the sex part not applicable to your situation but because one member feels torn between the two other members who ask them to constantly pick sides your wife likely feels she has to pick emotional sides between her brother and you likely with more than this lock issue this is a real relationship you will have to invest time in and not just your wife the brother is going to need to be included in discussions decisions etc good luck these things can really test a marriage and people patience so long as everyone including the brother is of the same general mind on everyone helping out not mooching eventually moving on etc it is going to work

things being ruined and taken since they did instead they are willing dismiss the cousins behavior because that is girl stuff or the makeup kit she saved for is too expensive and adult for her well apparently it was not too adult for his adult daughters to ruin in some places this is grounds for arrest too your daughter is a minor and they are not and they are taking and destroying her things i would have a come to jesus conversation with your wife i would indicate that you know she wants to help her brother and his kids but she is forgetting that her priority is her own daughter her taking sides and defending them is damaging her relationship with her own child because she has been bearing the brunt of their bad behavior she is allowing 3 adults to bully and demean her child because she is so invested in her need to help her brother and you need to work on a plan and a timeline as to when they all need to get out unless things change drastically they are guests in your home and they

problem is or they might use ignorance as an excuse whilst you try and make plans for them to move on in the background i would suggest this you may have done this but first thing i would do is have the girls sit down together in a calm open discussion have zoe explain what makes her uncomfortable if she does not feel comfortable you could do it and set a new standard some clear boundaries say it is your and zoe's house and your standard needs to be respected if they wish to stay ask them politely to replace the makeup they used with a new identical set and give them the one they used they did not ask to use it so they should not have if they are both 18 it should not be too hard for them to afford that say they are not to enter her room under any circumstances while she is not there if

boundaries and privacy were being violated so much she was moving stuff out of the house entirely that is not typical teenage girls behavior that is jerk roommate behavior if she was in a college dorm i would tell her to ask about changing rooms entirely i had a roommate once that ate my food stole my stuff and even let someone in to the apartment who peed all over my bed lied about the whole thing and when i confronted him with video footage of him taking stuff on camera he could not even come up with a reason why i have zero patience for people who violate boundaries and borrow each others stuff like that x200b it sounds like you and your daughter are on the same page with how she is feeling and the kinds of boundaries she is wanting to keep around sammy and his kids it also feels like your wife is not fully understanding or is not choosing to understand how your daughter feels about this bring your wife into this x200b have your wife and daughter sit down just the three of you and ask your daughter to explain to your wife how she feels about what is going on when my laptop is taken i feel x when soandso used my makeup set and messed up the color shades i felt y that sort of thing the key here is to focus on how your daughter feels and not soandso keeps doing this soandso took my stuff because no one can tell your daughter her feelings are not true x200b along the way have your wife repeat that back to her she needs to make your daughter feel heard no matter what your wife feels about the whole family relationship dynamic going on here if your wife wants to have a good and growing relationship with your daughter she needs to ensure your daughter feels heard through this and future situations x200b i know this all sounds a bit clinical and it kind of is but it is been a huge help in past conflicts i have been a part of or helped others work through sorry for the novel feel free to dm me anytime you want if you would like help working through it or just need

ruined it point two you are 100 correct you did offer them a place to live when nobody else stepped up they should be respectful and thankful it should not be your role to keep them happy if your daughter was taking their property and not respecting their boundries they would be pissed as it happens you are the ones putting yourself out because you care point three your inlaw should not be telling you how to run your home you have put the locks in place because your daughter wants privacy and is tired of her things being messed with she as a young lady has every right to her own space she has had to make adjustments because the house is more crowded the lock should stay to give her peace of mind as for his lecture on your daughters age appropriate make up any kid that can save 60 on their own and buy it has the maturity to own it she is a teenager after all he should not be lecturing you on how to raise your daughter in your house she is not the one messing with peoples property without consent sure hope you can solve this matter my advice is let the in laws know they would not be there if they were not welcome let them know you love them but your daughter has had to make tough adjustments and giving her a lock on her door is the least you can do to give her her own space and comfort they should respect it and drop the subject because the lock stays even if she says it can go tell them she should not be guilted into making more sacrifices in her own home she deserves to have boundaries and explore her own sense of self and that you trust her to have her own

roof taking your charity if he is showing anything other than deference and gratitude you remind him where he is same goes for the kids you are trying to use reason and get them to understand you are doing that because your side is reasonable and you think they should understand reason and change their ways it is admirable it is fair and it is also a complete waste of your time your house your rules end of story do not let them argue with you or deflect if you want them to jump they can ask how high you tried to be reasonable it clearly did not and will not work not in the long run and in the meantime your kid is still going to be dealing with a hostile environment imagine your mom giving you the silent treatment because you did not want to be a victim in your own home your wife needs

resolution and communication skills are atrocious for a person who has an almostgrown daughter it would have been reasonable to talk to your wife about how inadequate her attempt to resolve this was to insist that full repayment for the makeup was made to speak to your bil and explain that your daughter was hiding his stuff because his kids really are thieves and to empower your daughter to fight her own corner on this yes sharing stuff is normal between sisters but so are vicious and sometimes violent fights until everyone matures enough to respect each other's boundaries and if your daughter has no siblings she is not used to sharing her space or representing herself these are valuable life skills you would be surprised how many only children really struggle with territorial disputes in house shares or workplaces when they first leave home and mummy and daddy cannot just make it all better for them buying and fitting a lock without consulting your wife is just a dick move it undermines her when she is said she will deal with it and it shows you do not think her opinion or input are valuable which is made worse by there being other adults in the house to witness it and then you said it was a matter for communication between your wife and yourself when this failure to communicate was noticed you cannot have it both ways and this is not gradea husbanding or wifing you did not specify the reasons the other adults here suck are more obvious your bro in law's kids probably do not see this as a big deal because they have shared their whole lives and have never had to negotiate boundaries in the same way and it sounds like their ability to show respect is compromised by their role models all being quite dismissive of them and of each other when boundaries are violated but they are old enough to know that if they take something and someone is upset by their actions they are financially and personally responsible for making it right they should not need to be instructed to apologise or to replace a damaged item at their age your bro in law probably feels outnumbered by having twins and has not bothered to discipline them and he is failing to respect anybody at all here in his desire to indulge his daughters' behaviour he is also criticising you and your wife for your parenting whilst living in your home rude he should be offering to replace the damaged item if he is daughters refuse and it would have been reasonable for you to set that expectation you did not it sounds like you just lost your temper at him instead of setting this out verbally it is clear that in your opinion he has long outstayed his welcome but you do not seem to have discussed this with him or your wife or set proper boundaries for his stay and your wife does not suck for her feelings towards you but should have listened to and stuck up for her daughter a lot better than she did before it came to this point where your expectations and parenting choices differ from hers it is her responsibility as well as yours to communicate properly and manage conflicts with a little more maturity than any of you currently seem to be able to muster edit closing a

choosing to leave with them as soon as possible and contacting someone for all her legal needs you have already talked with someone and she will need this card for her own legal actions in the other hand is another card one for a therapist for counseling for you both by choosing this hand she will agree her brother as well as his children need to be out of the house before the end of the week and not be welcomed back she will enforce boundaries with her family as well as apologize to your daughter for causing her stress and allowing other to violate her rights she will also agree to individual counseling for herself as well as apologize to you for allowing your rights to your home to be disrespected let her know that if in anyway shape or form if zoeys room becomes compromised while she is away or you both are you will be getting the police involved in making sure her brother his kids and her are all out of that door and criminally charges will be brought up against her brother as well

and salvage the underneath but she is totally right sloane damaged it significantly because now all of the colors will smudge and turn shades of brown i would lose it if someone did that to my palettes it is so rude teenage girls borrow things with permission they ask first it is a running thing in books and shows and films that teens and 20somethings who borrow items without permission are being rude and it makes them unpopular with their peers precisely because it is bad to do that the fact that sammy and his ex did not teach their children to be upstanding humans with basic decency is not your fault or zoey's your wife needs to consider whether being a mother or an aunt is more important to her because the way you both handle this moment will be ingrained in zoey's mind forever she will remember that you defended her autonomy and privacy and that mom said it is fine for people to invade her space and take her things that is going to be something that she recalls all through her life because how you act is more meaningful than what you say mom is encouraging zoey to tolerate people making her feel unsafe and uncomfortable and that is a terrible thing to teach a child it impacts their entire self perception at that age it tells them that friends and partners who take what they want without permission are the normal ones and she is the one who is wrong for wanting to set limits it impacts how easily you cave to peer pressure how quickly a no is coerced into a yes from a boygirlfriend in the future it is not just today with how you both deal with her cousins it is how she views her needs and rights regarding her body and her things mom may not realize that but you are teaching zoey that she can say no to people and mom is teaching her that sometimes people

told him he said my daughters are not thieves it is normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and should not

before contacting the mod team my brother inlaw sammy lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago he moved in with us and brought his twin daughters olivia sloane18 with him a couple of months ago his sister my wife and i have one daughter zoey 16 and she and her cousins are not close but get along fine olivia sloane have no respect for zoeys privacy none they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on makeup phone accessories clothes school laptop etc zoey complained a lot and i have already asked the girls to respect zoeys privacy and stop taking things my wife and sammy saw no issue with this after all they are girls and this is typical teenage girls behavior i completely disagreed last straw was when zoey bought a 60 mac makeupkit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it do not know much about makeup but that is what zoey said when she found the kit on her bed and was crying i told my wife and she said she would ask sloane to apologize but i got zoey a lock after i found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence sammy and his daughters saw the lock and were not happy the girls were extremely upset sammy asked about it and i straight up told him he said my daughters are not thieves it is normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and should not even be buying expensive adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this defect in zoeys personality trying to appear older than she is he accused me of being overprotective and babying zoey with this level of enablement i told him this is between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on zoeys door for her cousins to see and preventing them from spending time with her saying i was supposed to treat them like daughters then demanded i remove it but i said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house she got mad i was implying we kick them out and said her familyll hate me for this so i reminded her that i let sammy and his family move in which is something her own family refused to do so she should start with shamingblaming them for not taking their own son and niecesgranddaughters in if it was not for her familys unwillingness to help we would not be dealing with this much disturbance at home everyone is been giving me and zoey silent

perception is overriding that you drawing a line at the brother in law moving out has only reinforced that perception you have no moral obligation to do what i am about to suggest you are 100 in the

soooo wrong in soooo many levels and there are a few boundaries you need to set sorry but this comment will be huge 1 you need to talk to your wife she's being a bad mom and many levels she needs to change drastically otherwise the damage done to your daughter their relation and your marriage will be huge 1a her priority should be her daughter she should be defending your daughter and taking her problems seriously by degrading her feelings she's causing very much harm she's harming her motherdaughterrelationship and she's harming zoey's psychological health i wouldn't wonder if zoey goes lowcontact to her once she's able to move out because her mother isn't taking her biggest job seriously protecting her 1b if her own family didn't want their own flesh and blood in their houses why does she think they expect you to put up with his shit that's not how this works 1c you have no obligation to be accomodating them even less to treat them like your daughters but you can play along and say you need to teach kids how to be decent human beings people need to understand and respect boundaries those girls don't respect any of zoey's so you're making sure they learn it the hard way 1d by teaching zoey she needs to give in to everyone overstepping her boundaries she'll learn she's worth nothing she'll learn it's okay to be treated poorly she'll accept anything anyone does to her what does your wife want that zoey ends in an abusive relationship because she never learned to set boundaries never learned her worth but learned that her own mother will never back her up when she needs her because that's exactly what she's teaching zoey 2 bil interfering with your education you give your daughter is a big nono you need to kill those atempts radically he is a guest and not a parent he can educate his own brats but not your daughter 2a actually i have 2 anectodes for that and that's the only right way to react when i was about zoey's age i really wanted a allstars the shoes i was even wanting to pay for them myself because i just thought they were sooo cool when we were at my grandma's house my uncle my mom's brother came by and heard i wanted those shoes and my dad was thinking of buying me a pair he started going on about teaching kids they can't have everything any my father should buy me fake ones i wouldn't need original ones my father calmly looked at my uncle and said he doesn't interfere on how he raises his children living their expensive lifestyle and stuff and how on earth did my uncle expect that his opinion was asked in the way my father raised his daughter that's none of his business and he has no right to even think he can say anything to that matter my uncle a person who never loses his voice were absolutely speecheless and left shortly after another time i was already an adult but living under my parents' roof my aunt also my mom's sister came over and was talking to my parents how they shouldn't let me go on holidays by myself and they were being bad parents by not taking care of me properly my dad pretty much exploded and showed her where the door was 3 if guests can't act like guests they don't deserve being treated like ones if they don't respect boundaries they need to pack their stuff and leave bil is already overstaying and needs to get his shit together and move out otherwise his parents need to step in and take them in if her family starts taking shit about and to you show them their hipocrisy why is it your job to take them in but not theirs bil is not your kid he's theirs as my mom would say chilli just hurts when it's in your asshole 4 you need to protect zoey because apparatly she has no one else she needs to be able to count on you don't back down stand your ground go through hell if it's necessary but your daughter needs to know she's loved and valued edit 5 go buy your daughter a new make up set if you can afford it and give the old one to charity not to those brats and let them use your wife's make up instead if your wifes insists that sharing is caring also tell your wife she needs to share her own stuff with the twins she needs to set a good example as a mother right

a lock on their cousin's door particularly when your daughter worked a job to save her own money for something she wanted makes me wonder if this may be the reason the twins are not living with their

brother's side and her nieces' side then maybe she would be okay with the nieces taking her things without out asking not saying you need to encourage that behavior but if it happens it should be no big deal to your wife furthermore if they are 18 and taking things from your daughter then i would get a safe and lock away your valuables lastly i would ask you this not that you have to answer but

theirs and it was up to them if they wanted to share it or noteven with their siblings our daughter was not allowed to borrow or lend items that we provided however we did not have to drive this home

she is doing it to her own child it is easier to let you and zoey suffer than confront her dysfunctional brother and to some extent herself she can only live with one side being unhappy and you are going to have to assert that that side is not you and zoey it is a huge struggle because while she does not want to lose you or zoey she does not want her brother to feel unhappy in any way even if it is at you zoey's expense she probably figures that you should understand as she once had to you have to stand your ground in order to show her that that is unacceptable you are her husband not an enabler and you are the last alarm for this ship before it sinks into dysfunction maybe as a child your wife was expected to \"understand\" \"get over it\" or sacrifice things that were dear to her because her family shamed her and said she was \"selfish\" for even remotely thinking about her herself bil is probably fully aware of this and uses it to his advantage by \"shaming\" your daughter into relenting as hehis family once did your wife and he is challenging you too but there is only 'one cock on this hill' and it are not him and you noted that her own family did not want to deal with bil they expect her to sacrifice her things you and zoey included because they cannot afford him using up their resources and in some way your wife probably doing that with zoey it is okay to sacrifice and destroy her things because your wife cannot afford to be that one again i agree with everyone that said you need to hold your ground and set a date for bil and the girls to leave the

going to show out and bil's going to amp that shit up to 1000000 on your wife he is going to go for the emotional jugular \"how could you do this\" \"you are letting him decide i am your brother\" \"your daughter is a spoiled brat you are putting your kid's feelings over mine\" \"you really want us to be homeless\" the answer to all those questions are yes yes yes yes because there is a reason why bil's ass is divorced and it is not you or your wife's duty to save him your wife has to understand that if you do not do this now it will never end because it will never be enough for bil and

worked in child psychology and i want to add this to your defense as a 16yo and a dependent she had zero control over this change in her life it is great that she seems to be handling it maturely and it is entirely reasonable that you and your wife expect her to handle it maturely but it is always worth noting that the parents made the decision and to her it is just something that happened to her i think letting her have her room as a truly private space is a good idea even if it does look like she is sulking being antisocial or being selfish in there kids sort of need a way to feel like they have control over parts of their life or they are at risk of developing fatalism and with it feelings of impotence also a 16 year old may seem pretty adult but their brains are still growing certain parts such as emotional maturity and this includes her capacity for empathy sharing belongings should be her choice because if she has no choice in the matter she has no chance to grow by making the decision without being able to choose sharing or selfishness her only choice will be whether or not she feels like a victim a martyr or a forgotten nobody and she might choose selfishness and it is reasonable to consider that the wrong choice but teenagers fuck up and you kind of have to let them turn those fuck ups into learning moments you should also know that the trauma of losing a house and parents splitting may result in tumultuous feelings that lead a person to test whether the people around you care about you it could easily be part of why their family seems volatile about this issue and your bil may be unconsciously creating guilty feelings in your wife by making her feel tested she will need your support too you might find good resources in books about setting healthy boundaries
